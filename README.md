**Worlds Worst Text Adventure™**

World's Worst Text Adventure™ is a bad attempt at a text adventure engine and game written in Python.

It originally started as a Python learning exercise and has slowly grown from there.

It currently includes one story that goes nowhere.

The engine can handle items, rooms, and doors but has no mechanism for NPCs.

To play, simply download and run the following command from the container folder:

python wwta.py
